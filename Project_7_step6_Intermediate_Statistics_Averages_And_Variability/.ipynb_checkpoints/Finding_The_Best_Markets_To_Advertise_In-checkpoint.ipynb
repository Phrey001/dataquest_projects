    "- In this project, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion we reached is that the **US would be a good market to advertise in in terms of both potential customers and spending powers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose although **Canada could be a good choice in terms of balancing between both spending power and number of potential customers.** We suggest to collaborate by sending the results to the marketing team to leverage on their domain knowledge to attempt a more optimal solution.\n",

    "- Analysing other data sets\n",
